# Single-stream demo on the serial console. Runs ON THE BOARD as root.
#
# The DisplayPort renderer can only start once Linux is up, which is long after
# the interesting part: by then wolfBoot has already verified and booted the
# kernel, and the pane can only replay that from the DDR ring. On the UART there
# is nothing to replay - wolfBoot's own ML-DSA-87 verification prints live,
# seconds after power-on, and everything below simply continues the same stream:
#
#   wolfBoot (A55)  verified boot of Linux      - printed by wolfBoot itself
#   [M7 ]           wolfBoot ML-DSA-87 -> Zephyr on the Cortex-M7
#   [A55]           wolfCrypt ML-KEM / ML-DSA benchmarks, in a container
#
# Each source is prefixed so one scrolling stream stays readable, and output
# goes to the console the kernel already owns, so a plain `screen`/`picocom` on
# the host records the whole demo with no display, no KMS and no X.
